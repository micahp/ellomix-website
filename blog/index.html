    What a wonderful sight to see. Groves of black folk making pilgrimages to
    the movie theater dressed in traditional African regalia to celebrate the
    release of the first high budgeted movie about a black superhero. A movie
    based in Africa, with black writers, directors, and actors, being told from
    a black perspective.
    <strong>
        This movie marks the beginning of a new black cinematic age that
        expresses itself boldly amongst the most hostile political landscape
        our country has seen in decades.

        soundtrack
    </a>
    for the movie, produced by Kendrick Lamar, was a major component to making
    this movie a masterpiece. Eight of the songs from the soundtrack charted on
    the Billboard Hot 100. Although I expected a soundtrack produced by an
    American Hip Hop Artist to contain mainly American Hip Hop &amp; R&amp;B, I
    still expected a more African influenced soundtrack. The soundtrack
    features mainly Hip Hop &amp; R&amp;B Artists, but featured four African
    musicians (Saudi, Yugen Blatrok, Babes Wodumo, Sjava) all from South
    Africa, which many would argue is the most westernized country in Africa. I
    find this slightly problematic. Not blaming Kendrick Lamar, but the lack of
    global education of the diversity of African Culture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Where do we go from here? I expect more racially influenced movies, albums,
    art, and other creative outlets of expression in the Era of Trump. Perhaps
    a real life Black Panther Superhero who will unite black people across the
    world to fight off colonization and oppression, but perhaps that hero has
    already existed.

    There a number of politically motivated, vigilant, rebellious, and hero
    like musicians who stood up for something greater than themselves, but I am
    unsure if there was an artist with as much virtuoso and audacity as the
    late and great, Fela Kuti.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Nigerian born musician connected the Black Diaspora and his music
    fought imperialism across the world. Fela’s mother was a feminist activist
    during the anti-colonial movement and his father, an Anglican minister and
    school principal, served as the first president of the Nigerian Union of
    Teachers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After being sent to London to study medicine, Fela decided to study music
    and formed a band that fused Jazz and Highlife (predecessor to Afrobeat).
    This band moved to Ghana to think up a new music direction and this is
    where Afrobeat, one of Africa’s most prominent sounds, was created.
    Afrobeat is a combination of Jazz, Soul, Funk and Traditional Yoruba Music.
    <br/>
    Fela would then take his band to Los Angeles where he discovered the Black
    Power Movement through the Black Panther Party. This had a profound impact
    on his music content shifting his focus from love songs to discussing
    social issues.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the 1970’s and 80’s Fela’s rebellious song lyrics established his
    reputation as a political dissident. Questioning Nigerian soldier’s blind
    obedience to carry out orders, colonialism, greed, and corruption are some
    of the many topics Fela covered. Fela’s music seeks to empower the
    disenfranchised masses to rise up against the government. Fela was arrested
    by the Nigerian Government over 200 times as a result of his rebellious
    music leading to multiple raids and destruction of his village, beatings,
    life long scars, and his mother being thrown from the 3rd floor of her
    home, falling to her death. Fela used these traumatic experiences as
    inspiration to create new material because he believed MUSIC IS THE WEAPON
    as it still is today.
